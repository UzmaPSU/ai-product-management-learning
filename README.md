# 🧠 How I’m Learning AI Product Management - Step by Step
*A learning guide & playbook by Uzma Mustafa*

Constantly updated as I learn, build, and experiment in the world of AI-powered product management.

---

## 💡 Why This Exists

AI is reshaping how PMs think, build, and prioritize.  
This repo documents my journey of learning and applying **AI thinking in product work** — from foundational ML understanding to building GenAI-driven user experiences.  

> This isn’t theory. It’s a living document — a blend of frameworks, hands-on projects, and battle-tested resources.

## 🚀 My Learning Path

| Phase | Focus | Key Skills & Resources |
|:------|:------|:-----------------------|
| **1️⃣ Foundations** | Learn how AI works under the hood | Andrew Ng’s *AI for Everyone*, Aakash Gupta’s *AI PM Playbook*, Google’s ML Crash Course |
| **2️⃣ Product Meets AI** | Design with AI constraints | Building LLM Products, Prompt Engineering Guide, OpenAI Cookbook |
| **3️⃣ Build & Experiment** | Launch small GenAI projects | Streamlit, LangChain, Hugging Face APIs, GPT fine-tuning |
| **4️⃣ Measure & Iterate** | Develop AI KPIs and feedback loops | Precision, Recall, BLEU, user trust metrics, explainability |
| **5️⃣ Scale & Integrate** | Data pipelines & collaboration | MLOps, human-in-the-loop systems, model versioning |

## 🧩 AI PM Frameworks

1. **ICED** — *Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort × Data quality*  
2. **RICE (AI-adjusted)** — prioritize by technical feasibility & data maturity  
3. **LLM Opportunity Canvas** — *Problem → AI Leverage → Risks → Feedback loops*  
4. **Human + AI Loop Model** — define what AI automates vs what humans supervise  
5. **AI Ethics Checklist** — bias, transparency, reproducibility, consent

---

## 🧠 How I Study Each Topic

- **Learn:** one focused AI/PM concept a day (from Substack, paper, or lecture)  
- **Summarize:** write three clear takeaways in Notion — in my own words  
- **Apply:** rebuild a mini project or workflow using that idea  
- **Share:** post or write a breakdown to teach it forward  

> Inspired by Aakash Gupta’s loop — *Learn → Apply → Teach → Compound.*
